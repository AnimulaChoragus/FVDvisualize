resonance_quench_evolution_s.mp4 and resonance_ramp_evolution_s.mp4 is the real-time evolution of the system for both the quench and ramp protocols.

The energy landscape of the product states at 𝑉/Δ𝑙 ≈ 2 (the resonance condition for 𝐿 = 2 bubbles). 

Each blue dot in the landscape represents a manifold of product states, grouped by their Hamming distance from the |Néel⟩ state and their relative static energy 𝐸/𝑉. 

The area of each dot is proportional to the occupation probability of the state manifold at different times 𝑡 after a quench (𝛺/2𝜋 = 1.8 MHz).
